# Chat Bot

Chat Bot is an innovative project designed to leverage the Gemini API and LangChain for advanced document analysis capabilities. This project enables advanced parsing, insightful analysis, and streamlined data extraction from PDF documents.

## Project Files

- `app.py`: The main application file that runs the Chat Bot.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of all the dependencies and libraries required to run the project.
## Installation

To get started with the Chat Bot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create an environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your Google API key:
    ```plaintext
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-generated-api-key-from-google-ai-studio"
    ```

## Running the Application

Once you have installed all the required libraries, run the application with:
```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
This will start the Streamlit server, and you will be able to interact with the Chat Bot through your web browser.
